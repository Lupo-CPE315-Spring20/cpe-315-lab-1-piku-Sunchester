# CPE 315 Lab 1 -- Piku

## Things to include in your README

* NAME: Tiger Sun 
* STATUS: Complete
* At first, I ran into issues of compilation where I was getting "Bad instruction"
I was very confused. Then I looked into the ARM Guide and realized I was confusing
my l's for 1's, foolish mistake! I found it interesting that I had to use r0 for 
all three printf's for the provided code. When I experimented with r0, r1, and r2
I received a segmentation fault, which was very interesting.

These README files have a fairly rich _Markdown_ environment. You should use
markdown syntax to format your README files in such a way that they look
professional, and are easy to read. Use the 
[Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and
have fun! :octocat:
